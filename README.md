# CRUD with Go Language
CRUD with Go language + MySQL

To run this code, first thing you must have is Go and MySQL as database

----

1. Run MySQL (In my laptop, I use XAMPP)
2. Run go mod tidy
3. Create and edit .env file (you can refer to .envexample)
4. Run go run main.go
5. And open http://localhost:7878 (You can edit this port in main.go file)
